### Part 1 - parsing

The job of the `parse` step is to convert the program represented as a string into a representation we can work with in the `evaluate` step.

This representation, called the abstract syntax tree (AST), will look like this for our language:


```python
>>> from diylisp.parser import parse
>>> program = """
...   (define fact 
...       ;; Factorial function
...       (lambda (n) 
...           (if (eq n 0) 
...               1 ; Factorial of 0 is 1, and we deny 
...                 ; the existence of negative numbers
...               (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
... """))
>>> parse(program)
['define', 'fact', ['lambda', ['n'], ['if', ['eq', 'n', 0], 1, ['*', 'n', ['fact', ['-', 'n', 1]]]]]]
```

- Comments are removed.
- Symbols are represented as strings.
- The lisp list expressions are represented as Python lists.
- The symbols `#t` and `#f` are represented by Pythons `True` and `False, respectively.
- Integers are represented as Python integers.

The parsing is done in `parsing.py`. It is your job to implement the `parse` function.
A lot of the gritty work of counting parentheses and such has been done for you, but you must stitch everything together.

Have a look at the provided functions in the module, and start working. Run the following command until all tests pass.
